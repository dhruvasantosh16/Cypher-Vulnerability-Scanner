Cypher is a automated vulnerability scanner that can be deployed on a Raspberry Pi. When the ethernet jack is inserted into the Raspberry Pi, Cypher performs a number of vulnerability assessments, generates a report and sends it via email to the analyst.

This script will autorun when the ethernet jack is plugged in and all the dependencies are stored in the Raspberry Pi. This script can also be programmed to run certain scripts at regular intervals of time to ensure that the systems on the network are free from vulnerabilities 

Modules:
Autorun functionality
Vulnerability Scanner
Scripting Engine
Email Sender
Report Generator

Goal:
After the successful completion of this program in Python, I would want to port it to C or Go to increase speed and efficiency. I would also want to hard code this into a custom PCB with over the air updates to commercialize the use of this program.
